# An Universal MUN Signup & Workfile Management System
## What on hell is that ?
  We developed it to lessen the work of the commitee.You can just use this system to figure out all the stuff like recording a delegate and let the delegate to enrich his/her infomation, so you can just sit down and have a cup of coffee, waiting all the delegates to submit their personal infomation.
